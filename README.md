# Identification-of-large-scale-turbulent-structures



#This code allows the user to acquire large-scale structures in turbulence flows directly from a velocity field using U-net. To train the U-net from scratch run the gen_histogram.py and Unet_training.py files back to back. Alternatively, there are several uploaded pre-trained weight files from which 055
